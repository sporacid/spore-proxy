# ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

`spore-proxy` uses stateful meta-programming to build compile-time type sets of known facades, implementations and
dispatch mappings. All this data is iterated once per translation unit to register mappings into a dispatch table
implementation. Since the dispatch expects idempotency, registering the same mapping multiple times is not an issue.

When the library sees a call to `spore::proxies::dispatch`, a new mapping is registered at compile time. When the
dispatch call is invoked at runtime, the mapping is registered for all known implementations of this mapping. This
allows to register template instantiation without any issues!

# üèõÔ∏è Facades

A facade define a callable interface that dispatches to implementation. Dispatching doesn't have to be on a function
member, it can dispatch however it likes. Facades must derive from `proxy_facade`, which takes the facade as a
template parameter, plus optionally, additional facade to derived from. Here is a typical example of a facade:

```cpp
struct facade : proxy_facade<facade>
{
    void act() const
    {
        constexpr auto f = [](const auto& self) { self.act(); };
        proxies::dispatch(f, *this);
    }
};
```

## Facade inheritance

Facades can inherit from one another, but not directly. It must be done with `proxy_facade` to make sure that base
facades are visible to the dispatching system.

```cpp
struct base : proxy_facade<base> {};
struct facade : proxy_facade<facade, base> {};
```

In this example, `facade` would inherit from `base_facade` and implementations are expected to implement both facades.

# üì® Dispatching

When a facade invokes `spore::proxies::dispatch`, there's both a compile-time and a runtime side effect occurring. At
compile-time, a new unique mapping is created with the invocation's unique information. At runtime, the mapping will be
registered once per translation unit, then, there will be a lookup for a dispatch function for the specific
implementation. Finally, the dispatch function will be invoked with forwarded arguments from the facade.

The dispatching system uses an ever-increasing zero-based index to ensure fast lookup. Therefore, finding a specific
dispatch function for an implementation is O(1) and is guaranteed, under the current dispatch implementations, to be a
random access lookup into a contiguous memory region.

## Static Dispatcher

The static dispatcher implementation, `proxy_dispatch_static`, uses a static array to store dispatch functions. There is
one such array per mapping type, e.g.

```cpp
template <typename mapping_t>
static inline proxies::detail::dispatch_type<mapping_t> dispatches[size_v] {};
```

The size limits therefore limits the number of implementations for a specific mapping. For example,
`proxy_dispatch_static<16>` means that for any single mapping type, a maximum of 16 implementations are possible. You
can use this dispatcher type when the number of implementation of a given facade is small and known beforehand.

## Dynamic Dispatcher

The dynamic dispatcher implementation, `proxy_dispatch_dynamic`, uses one `std::vector` to store dispatch functions.
There is one vector per mapping type, per-thread, to ensure thread safety without locks, e.g.

```cpp
template <typename mapping_t>
static inline thread_local std::vector<proxies::detail::dispatch_type<mapping_t>> dispatches {size_v};
```

You can use this dispatcher type when the number of implementation of a given facade is unknown.

## Default Dispatcher

The default dispatcher can be overridden with the macro definition `SPORE_PROXY_DISPATCH_DEFAULT`, e.g.

```cpp
#define SPORE_PROXY_DISPATCH_DEFAULT spore::proxy_dispatch_static<16>

#include "spore/proxy/proxy.hpp"
```

By default, `proxy_dispatch_dynamic` is used as a default.

## Overriding Dispatchers

Dispatchers can be overridden for each facade by declaring a `dispatch_type` typedef. The inheritance chain will be
looked up for an override if the current facade doesn't override the dispatcher. If no override is found, the default
dispatcher will be used for this facade.

```cpp
struct facade : proxy_facade<facade>
{
    using dispatch_type = proxy_dispatch_static<16>;
};
```

## Thread Safety

All dispatch implementations are guaranteed to be thread-safe (hopefully).
